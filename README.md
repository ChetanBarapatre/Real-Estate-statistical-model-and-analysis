Actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis.

DESCRIPTION

Problem Statement

A banking institution requires actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis.

The mortgage bank would like to identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate.

A statistical model needs to be created to predict the potential demand in dollars amount of loan for each of the region in the USA. Also, there is a need to create a dashboard which would refresh periodically post data retrieval from the agencies. The dashboard must demonstrate relationships and trends for the key metrics as follows: number of loans, average rental income, monthly mortgage and ownerâ€™s cost, family income vs mortgage cost comparison across different regions. The metrics described here do not limit the dashboard to these few.
